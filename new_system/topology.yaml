# Home Lab Topology v4.0.0 - OSI-Layer Architecture
#
# This file uses !include directives to load modular layer files.
# Layers are processed in order L0 → L7 (dependencies resolved bottom-up).
#
# Layer Structure:
#   L0: Meta        - version, defaults, policies
#   L1: Foundation  - physical devices, interfaces
#   L2: Network     - networks, bridges, firewall
#   L3: Data        - storage, backup policies
#   L4: Platform    - VMs, LXC containers
#   L5: Application - services, certificates
#   L6: Observability - monitoring, alerts
#   L7: Operations  - workflows, documentation
#
# Edit layer files then regenerate: python3 scripts/regenerate-all.py

version: "4.0.0"
