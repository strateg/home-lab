# Home Lab Network Topology v2.2 - Modular Structure
# Infrastructure-as-Data: Single Source of Truth
# Used to generate: Terraform configs, Ansible inventory, network diagrams, documentation
#
# This is the main topology file that includes all modular components.
# Edit individual files in topology/ directory and use generators.
#
# Principles:
# - Modular structure for better maintainability
# - Clear separation: physical_topology, logical_topology, compute, services
# - ID-based references (not hardcoded IPs)
# - Trust zones for security automation
# - Dynamic IP generation friendly
# - Single environment (production) - extensible to multi-env if needed

version: "2.2.0"
