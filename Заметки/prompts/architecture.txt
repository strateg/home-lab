Use Terraform to provision Proxmox objects (bridges, VM/LXC NIC attachments, SDN),
 use Ansible (or cloud-init + Ansible) to configure OS-level networking and services, 
 and keep a YAML/JSON topology as the canonical source-of-truth that you transform into Terraform, diagrams, and Ansible inventory. 
 This gives you reproducibility, verifiable plans, and documentation that Claude Code can parse and manipulate easily.
