 I have a  orange pi 5 . What would you suggest to do me with that looking at the home-lab
  infrastructure?

● Looking at your home-lab infrastructure, the Orange Pi 5 could be a great addition given your main constraint: 8GB RAM on the Proxmox host (Dell XPS L701X).

  Recommended Uses for Orange Pi 5

  1. Offload Resource-Heavy Services (Best ROI)

  Your Proxmox has only ~4GB left after OPNsense. The Orange Pi 5 (especially 8GB+ model) could run:

  - Nextcloud - Currently planned for LXC at 10.0.30.30, but it's RAM-hungry
  - Media Server (Jellyfin) - The RK3588S has excellent hardware transcoding via VPU
  - Monitoring Stack - Prometheus + Grafana can consume significant resources

  2. Secondary/Backup Node

  - Backup server - Store Proxmox backups (vzdump) on attached NVMe
  - Redundant DNS - Second AdGuard/Pi-hole instance (primary on GL.iNet)
  - Database replica - PostgreSQL standby for your 10.0.30.10 instance

  3. Kubernetes Playground

  - Run K3s lightweight Kubernetes
  - Learn container orchestration without consuming Proxmox resources
  - Could join with Proxmox LXC nodes later

  4. Home Automation Hub

  - Home Assistant - Runs great on Orange Pi 5
  - GPIO for sensors/relays
  - Zigbee/Z-Wave coordinator (with USB adapter)

  My Top Suggestion

  Given your topology, I'd recommend: Move Nextcloud + media services to Orange Pi 5

  This would:
  - Free ~2GB RAM on Proxmox for more LXC containers
  - Take advantage of RK3588S hardware transcoding
  - Keep databases (PostgreSQL, Redis) on Proxmox for low-latency access
  - Add resilience (services survive Proxmox maintenance)

  Network integration: Add it to vmbr2 (INTERNAL, 10.0.30.x) or vmbr99 (MGMT) depending on use case.
