# L1 Foundation
# Part of Home Lab Topology v4.0.0
# Foundation inventory: owned/provider foundation nodes, interfaces, MACs, physical storage inventory
# Workload virtualization (VM/LXC) is modeled in L4 Platform only.
# Modular layout:
# - locations: topology/L1-foundation/locations/
# - devices: topology/L1-foundation/devices/
#   - owned/<class>/
#   - provider/<class>/
# - media: topology/L1-foundation/media/ (portable and fixed storage media registry)
# - media-attachments: topology/L1-foundation/media-attachments/ (slot <-> media bindings)
# - data-links: topology/L1-foundation/data-links/ (data links)
# - power-links: topology/L1-foundation/power-links/ (power cabling)
# Edit modules then regenerate: python3 topology-tools/regenerate-all.py
